# KEYrpt - Encryption and Decryption Tool

KEYrpt is a Python-based application built using the Kivy framework that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using three different cipher techniques: Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, and Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher. The application also includes features to analyze and break encrypted text.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**: Encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher method. Includes a "Break" feature to try all possible shifts.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: Encrypt and decrypt text using the Vigenère Cipher method. Includes a "Break" feature to attempt decryption with keys up to 5 letters long.
- **Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher**: Encrypt and decrypt text using a custom substitution alphabet. Includes an "Analyze" feature to count letter frequencies in the text.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Kivy, the application provides an intuitive graphical interface for easy interaction.
